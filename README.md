xi-android
==========

An Android frontend for the [Xi] text editor.

Note: this is based on an old version of Xi. Development started on Dec. 27, 2016 so in order to build the current version you'll want to checkout Xi/syntect versions from around that time.

Build and run
-------------

1. Set up rustc [for cross-compiling on Android], and build [xi-core][Xi] and [syntect] for Android with cargo, e.g. `cargo build --target i686-linux-android` for x86 Android
2. Put the resulting .so files inside the [jniLibs folder] `app/src/main/jniLibs/<target_arch>/`, target_arch is e.g. x86 or armeabiâ€“you should have `lib_xi-core_.so` and `lib_xi-syntect-plugin_.so` (syntax highlighting library).
3. Build the project normally with Android Studio
